# Arma 3 GunGame (Mainau)
Arma 3 GunGame **can be used with any Arma 3 Map and most of its mods, BUT** the Files in this repository are pre-configured to work on Mainau, a map made by [Panthor Life](https://panthor.de/). It also depends on the Panthor Life Mod Pack. **All dependencies can easily be removed**.

The Panthor Life Mod-Pack is free to use for private purposes, if you want to make your own public GunGame Server please refrain from using it!

# Features

This mission offers a classical GunGame mode (start with a weapon and get a new one for each kill). 

- Fully configurable areas on the map including loadout and weapon whitelists for each area
- Compatible with ACE (might need some tweaking when using without ACE)
- Players can vote which area of the map to play on
- Configurable weapon lists (weapons, number of kills, scopes, number of magazines, type of magazine)
- Different random loadouts
- [WIP] Database Features: log all kills and some stats to a database (can be disabled) 

## Database

If you want to use the database features you will need to install [ExtDB3](<https://bitbucket.org/torndeco/extdb3/wiki/Home>) on your server.

Your `extdb3-conf.ini` should look something like this.

```ini
[Main]
Version = 1

Randomize Config File = false
;; Randomizes Config File after loading.
;;   Recommend to turn on, if you have enabled filepatching on arma.

Allow Reset = false
;; Allows 9:RESET, usefull for development work

Thread = 0;
;; Option to force number of worker threads for extDB3.
;;   Auto = 0, Min = 2, Max = 6

[Log]
Flush = true;
;; Flush logfile after each update.
;;    Option really only usefull if running DEBUG BUILD

[GunGame]
IP = ip.of.your.db
Port = 3306
Username = username
Password = password
Database = databasename

```

Make sure to copy the `gg_sql.ini` file to your extDB `sql_custom` directory and verify that `db = 1` in `config\round_config.cpp`.

Create your database with the included `database.sql` script.

# Spawnpoint Script
To easily create a new "Map" you can use the following script.
Start by setting `spawns = ""`
Then use this Script which adds the spawn to a list and copies it to your clippboard. It also creates a marker so you know where you have been.

```
_marker = createMarkerLocal [format["marker_%1_%2",random 10,random 10],position player];  
_marker setMarkerColorLocal "ColorBlue";  
_marker setMarkerTypeLocal "mil_dot";  
_marker setMarkerAlphaLocal 1; 
spawns = spawns + format["{%1,%2,%3},",(getPosATL player)#0,(getPosATL player)#1,(getPosATL player)#2];  
copyToClipboard spawns;
```
